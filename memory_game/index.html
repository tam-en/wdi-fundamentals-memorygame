			Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. <br><br>
			Playing Concentration can help middle-age people and brain-addled developers find their keys and remember their shopping list <em>before</em> they get to the store.<br><br>
			This was brought to you by a beginner developer who can be reached via e-mail <a class="inline_a" href="mailto:tamis@leftelbow.com">here</a>.
